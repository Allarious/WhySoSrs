function varargout = part1first(varargin)
%PART1FIRST M-file for part1first.fig
%      PART1FIRST, by itself, creates a new PART1FIRST or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = PART1FIRST returns the handle to a new PART1FIRST or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PART1FIRST('Property','Value',...) creates a new PART1FIRST using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to part1first_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      PART1FIRST('CALLBACK') and PART1FIRST('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in PART1FIRST.M with the given input
%      arguments.
